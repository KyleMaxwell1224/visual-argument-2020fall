This is my piece titled "False Prophets", which aims to shed light on the problems we have in America with honoring problematic historical figures, which quite frequently tend to be Confederate "heroes". While the history of our country is very important to remember, we should not allow these long-standing monuments to stay standing. In fact, there are nearly 1800+ monuments still standing at the time of this project's creation (2020). My project gives two examples of the men behind the statues. These men were not good; in fact, they were quite terrible. But by supporting these statues, it further propegates the current culture of more subtle (but very present) systematic racism.
